# LabFlow
A visualisation tool for educational facilities to help students better manage their time and gain access to university resources.


##Â How to run
- Download the Expo Go app.
- Go to folder titled LabFlow (ensure the folder contains the file `App.js`) and run the command `npx expo start` in a terminal.
- A QR code will be generated in the terminal. Scan this using the Expo Go app or your phone camera app.
- The app should load and you can create an account to sign up or login if you have a pre-existing account.
- Since this is a demo and still a prototype I have saved the API token as a local environment variable (DO NOT CHANGE THIS OR AUTHENTICATION WILL FAIL).
